14. Question:
    - Which classes are aggregates of other classes? Checking all constructors of whole classes if they initialize for their parts?
    - Write constructors for parent and child classes. Remove redundant setter methods if any.

    Answer:

    - Cart is aggregated of Media. Store is aggregate of Media. CompactDisc is aggregated of Track.
    - Implemented in code.

15. Question:
    - If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?

    Answer:

    - The equals() function will return false.

17. Question:
    - What class should implement the Comparable interface?
    - In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method to reflect the ordering that we want?
    - Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
    - Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?

Answer:

    - Class Media should implement the Comparable interface.
    - The compareTo() method should return > 0 for greater than, == 0 for equal or < 0 for less than.
    - No, we can't because the Comparable interface is used for internal comparison and can only be Implemented once by class Media.
    - I will override the compareTo() method in DigitalVideoDisc.
