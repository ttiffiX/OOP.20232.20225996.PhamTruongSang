- Exercise10:
1. (If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title, then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?)

Java doesn't allow us to do that because the constructor already exists, it has the same type of parameter: DVD(String).
-> Computer don't know which method needs to be called.

- Exercise15:
1. (Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?)
Java is a Pass by Value programming language.

2.(After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?)
Because 2 objects o1 and o2 are the copied of 2 DVD variable. And when we swap two objects, it only changes the name of two objects not the DVD.

3.(After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?)
Because dvd and jungleDVD reference to an object, when we use setTitle(tittle) function, it will change the title of this object, then the jungleDVD will change the title too.
And when we make dvd to new DVD, it only changes dvd title (the copied of jungleDVD) such as the swap above.
