16. Question:
    - What are the advantages of Polymorphism?
    - How is Inheritance useful to achieve Polymorphism in Java?
    - What are the differences between Polymorphism and Inheritance in Java?

    Answer:

    - Advantages of polymorphism:
        + Code Reusability: provides the reuse of code, as methods with the same name can be used in different classes.
        + Flexibility and Dynamism
        + Reduced Complexity
        + Simplified Coding
        + Better Organization
        + Code Extensibility
        + Increased Efficiency

    - Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those inherited methods to perform different tasks, allow us to perform action in different ways.

    - Differences between Inheritance and Polymorphism:
        + Polymorphism is a concept where a function is defined in more than one form, whereas in inheritance, a new class inherits the features from an already existing class.
        + The concept of polymorphism applies to functions or methods, whereas inheritance applies to classes.
